## Creating Customer Segments (Unsupervised Learning)

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Please see **`customer_segments.ipynb`** for project details and code

The customer segments data is included as a selection of 440 data points (**`customers.csv`**) collected from clients of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal. More information can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).
